# Epp 2.1 The Logic of Quantified Statements

math: what is a predicate?
A template sentence that takes a finite number of variables to become a statement


math: what is a predicate variable's domain?
The set of all values ???


math: What does "R" mean?
The set of all real numbers


math: What does "Z" mean?
The set of all integer numbers


math: What does "Q" mean?
The set of all rational numbers


math: What does "∈" mean?
element of a set


math: What does "∉" mean?
not an element of a set


math: What does "x ∈ Z⁺" mean?
x is a positive integer


math: What does "x ∉ Q⁻" mean?
x is a negative rational number


math: What does "P(x) ⇒ Q(x)" mean?
Every element in P(x)'s truth set is in Q(x)'s truth set


math: What does "P(x) ⇔ Q(x)" mean?
P(x) and Q(x) have identical truth sets


math: What is the truth set of:
    { x ∈ Z⁺ | 0 < x < 5 }
{ 1, 2, 3, 4 }


math: What does "∀" mean?
For all


math: ∀ is the ... quantifier
universal


math: What is the form of a universal statement?
∀x ∈ D, Q(x)


math: When is a universal statement false?
∃x ∈ D, ~Q(x)


math: What is the method of exhaustion?
To show the truth of a predicate for all domain elements


math: what does "∃" mean?
there exists


math: ∃ is the ... quantifier
existential


math: What is the form of an existential statement?
∃x ∈ D, Q(x)


math: When is an existential statement false?
∀x ∈ D, ~Q(x)


math: What does "{ x ∈ D | P(x) }" mean?
The set of all x in D such that P(x) is true


math: What is a predicate's truth set?
The set of all domain values that make the predicate true


math: Restate informally:
    ∀x ∈ Z, x² ≥ 0
All integers have nonnegative squares


math: Restate informally:
    ∃x ∈ Z, x² = x
Some integer equals its square


math: Restate formally:
    No dogs have wings
∀ dogs d, d does not have wings


math: Restate formally:
    Some programs are structured
∃ program p, p is structured


math: What is the form of the universal conditional statement?
∀x, P(x) → Q(x)


math: Restate informally:
    Vx ∈ R, (x > 2) → (x² > 4)
If a real number is greater than 2, thens its square is greater than 4


# Epp 2.3 Arguments with Quantified Statements


math: What is the rule of universal instantiation?
--
  ∀x ∈ D, P(x)
  a ∈ D
∴ P(a)


math: What is the name of following argument form:
      All humans are mortal
      Socrates is human
    ∴ Socrates is mortal
--
Universal instantiation


math: What is the form of universal modus ponens?
--
  ∀x, P(x) → Q(x)
  P(a) for a particular a
∴ Q(a)


math: What is the name of the following argument form:
      If a number is even, then its square is even
      K is a particular even number
    ∴ K² is even
--
Universal modus ponens


math: What is the form of universal modus tollens?
--
  ∀x, P(x) → Q(x)
  ~Q(a) for a particular a
∴ ~P(a)


math: What is the name of the following argument form:
      All humans are mortal
      Zeus is not mortal
    ∴ Zeus is not human
--
Universal modus tollens


math: Complete the following:
      All CS majors must take MATH 143
      John is a CS major
    ∴ ...
--
John must take MATH 143


math: Complete the following:
      All professors are absent-minded
      Tom is not absent-minded
    ∴ ...
--
Tom is not a professor
