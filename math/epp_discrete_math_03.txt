# Epp 3.1 Elementary Number Theory and Methods of Proof

Is 1 prime?
No. Primes are > 1.


   n ∈ ℙ
   ∀ r, s ∈ Z
   n = r · s
?∴ r ..., s ...
----
r = 1 ∨ s = 1


   n ∉ ℙ
   ∃ r, s ∈ Z
   n = r · s
?∴ r ..., s ...
----
r ≠ 1 ∧ s ≠ 1


When is the following true:
    ∃ x ∈ D | Q(x)
Q(x) for at least one x in D


math: What is a constructive proof of existence?
To prove an existential statement by finding a domain element that satisfies the property


math: What is a nonconstructive proof of existence?
To prove an existential statement by showing that assuming otherwise leads to contradiction


math: What is the method of exhaustion?
To prove a universal statement by showing that all domain elements satisfy the property


math: What is the method of direct proof?
To prove a universal statement by showing that any particular but arbitrary domain element satisfies the property


math: What are the steps of a direct proof?
1. Rewrite statement as ∀ x ∈ D, P(x) → Q(x)
2. Suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen domain element
3. Suppose P(s)
4. Prove Q(x)


math: What does "begging the question" mean?
A logical fallacy where the truth of the conclusion is assumed.


How to disprove:
    ∀ x ∈ D, P(x) → Q(x)
Find x such that P(x) and ~Q(x)


# Epp 3.2 Direct Proof and Counterexample II: Rational Numbers


math: When is a number rational?
∃ a, b ∈ Z | r = a / b


math: Is 0.1212... rational?
Yes. 100x - x = 99x
          99x = 12
            x = 12 / 99


math: Is 2.0222... rational?
Yes. 100x - 10x = 90x
            90x = 182
              x = 182 / 90


math: What is a theorem?
A centrally important statement that is true


math: What is a lemma?
A statement that is only of interest to prove a theorem


math: What is a corollery?
A statement that follows easily from a theorem


# Epp 3.3 Direct Proof and Counterexample III: Divisibility


math: What does "d | n" mean (informally)?
d divides n


math: What does "d | n" mean (formally)?
∃ k ∈ Z, n = d · k


math: Is the following true?
    (k ≠ 0) → (k | 0)
Yes. 0 = k · 0


   a, b ∈ Z⁺
   a | b
?∴ a ≤ b
----
Yes. ∃ k ∈ Z⁺, b = k · a
     1 ≤ k
     a ≤ k · a
     a ≤ b


   a, b ∈ Z⁺
   b = k · a
?∴ k ∈ ...
----
k ∈ Z⁺


   a, b ∈ Z
?∴ is "3a + 9b" a multiple of 3
----
Yes. 3a + 9b = 3 · (a + 3b)

   a, b ∈ Z
?∴ 5 is a factor of 10ab
----
Yes. 10ab = 5 · (2ab)


math: What is the unique factorization theorem?
For all integers > 1, there exists a unique expression:
    n = p₁ᵉ¹ · p₂ᵉ² · ... · pₖᵉᵏ
    {p₁, ... pₖ} ∈ ℙ, {e1, ... ek} ∈ Z⁺


math: What is the standard form of 100?
100 = 2² · 5²


math: What is the standard form of 24?
24 = 2³ · 3


   m ∈ Z
   8 · 5 · m = 17 · 10 · 4
?∴ 17 | m
----
  8 · 5 · m = 17 · 10 · 4
  2³ · 5 · m = 2³ · 5 · 17 (unique factorization)
∴ 17 | m


   m, n ∈ Z⁺
   m² - n² = 20
?∴ m = ..., n = ...
----
  m² - n² = (m + n)(m - n)
  20 = (even · even) ∨ (even · odd)
  20 = (1 · 20) ∨ (2 · 10) ∨ (4 · 5)
∴ m = 6, n = 4


# 3.6 Indirect Argument: Contradiction and Contraposition


math: What is the method of contradiction?
A proof that supposes a statement as false and then shows this is contradictory


math: What is the method of proof by contraposition?
A direct proof of a statement's contraposition


math: What method to prove: "n² is even → n is even"?
Method of proof by contraposition (i.e. prove "n is odd → n² is odd")
