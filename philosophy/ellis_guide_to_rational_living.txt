A Guide To Rational Living by Albert Ellis

== Chapter 1: How Far Can You Go With Self-Therapy? ==

Main Argument: Self-therapy is a necessary, but rarely sufficient part of behavior change.
    -Self-therapy is limited
        -People misunderstand, distort, and oversimplify presented principles because they read what they _want_ to read.
        -People don't apply the concepts that they learn.
    -Therapy compensates for the pitfalls of self-therapy
        -A trained therapist checks whether a client truly understands the concepts
        -A trained therapist pushes clients to change.
        -A trained therapist is able to adapt the generic concepts to your dynamic life.
    -The book is intended to supplement therapy
        -Gives interested clients something to read.
        -For rare individuals the book will be sufficient for behavior change.


== Chapter 2: You Largely Feel The Way You Think ==

Main Argument: There is considerable evidence that humans feel the way they think.

Exposition:
    -Goals (Gs): To stay alive and be reasonably happy or satisfied:
        (1) by yourself
        (2) in your relationships with people
        (3) by producing and achieving
        (4) by being original and creative
        (5) by enjoying physical, emotional, and mental activities
    -Adversities (As): Events, encounters, experiences, or thoughts that interfere with your goals.
    -Beliefs (Bs): Beliefs, ideas, and philosophies about Adversities.
    -Rational Beliefs (RBs): Preferences and wishes that Adversities do not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I dislike failing at work.
            -I hate when people treat me unfairly.
    -Irrational Beliefs (IBs): Strong demands that Adversities must not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I absolutely must not fail at work and am a worthless person if I do.
            -People must never treat me unfairly and are rotten persons if they do.
    -Consequences (Cs): The result of Adversities and Beliefs.
    -Healthy Consequences (HCs): Constructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of regret or disappointment when you fail at work.
            -Determination and action to improve your skills.
            -Feelings of displeasure and disappointment when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of sadness and regret when you have the flu.
    -Unhealthy Consequences (UCs): Destructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of horror and self-downing when you fail at work.
            -Refusing to improve you skills and look for another job.
            -Feelings of rage and vindictiveness when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of depression and self-pity when you have the flu.

== Chapter 3: Feeling Well By Thinking Straight ==

Main Argument: Rational thinking increases your happiness and helps you achieve your goals.
    -Rational thinking does not entail being an emotionless robot
        -Unfounded societal expectation that getting the "most out of life" comes from highly "emotional" experiences
            -Example: going from deep depression to maniac joy to the bogs of despair
        -Rational thinking proponents still feel sorrow, pain, joy, and elation
        -Healthy emoting is rational and helps you achieve your goals
            -Example: Great desire for love might make you work harder, write poems, etc.
    -Rational thinking increases happiness
        -Rational thinking minimizes unhealthy, self-defeating emotions
        -Pleasant emotions and pursuits surface to the top
        -Unpleasant emotions (e.g. sorrow and regret) are healthy when they are constructive
            -Example: as signals that something has gone wrong and had better be corrected
    -The rational thinking approach is evidence-based
        -Book contains clinical, experimental, and personal evidence
        -You can experiment and try the approach for yourself.

Exposition:
    -Four process responsible for survival and happiness:
        -Senses (sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch)
        -Emotions (love, hate, joy, sadness)
        -Actions (walk, eat, swim, climb, play)
        -Thought (remember, imagine, hypothesis, conclude)
    -Four processes are intertwined:
        -Example 1:
            1. Sense: See an apple
            2. Emotion: Desirable or not?
            3. Thought: Useful or not?
            4. Action: Pick it up or throw away?
        -Example 2:
            1. Action: Pick up a stick
            2. Sense: See yourself holding stick
            3. Thought: Consider what to do with stick
            4. Emotion: Like or dislike stick
        -Example 3:
            -Limited: "Jones thinks about the puzzle"
            -Comprehensive: "Jones perceives-moves-emotes-and-thinks about the puzzle"
    -Considerable progress using technology to advance:
        -Senses (e.g. glasses, radar)
        -Actions (e.g. bicycles, aircrafts)
        -Thought (e.g. computers)
    -Emotional maturity and happiness are largely unchanged compared to past centuries

== Chapter 4: How You Create Your Feelings ==

Main Argument: REBT enables you to observe your feelings, determine their usefulness, and eventually choose how you want to feel and what will help you achieve what you want in life.
    -Unhealthy emotions stem from irrational beliefs and sabotage your goals and happiness
        -Unhealthy emotions come from irrational beliefs.
            -Example:
                A. Someone interviewing for a job.
                B. Suppose I make a fool of myself ... that would be *awful*.
                C. Depression and rage (This is awful! I would be an idiot!)
        -Irrational beliefs sustain negative emotions.
            Example: Someone steps on your toe.
                Immediate Emotion: Pain, anger
                Sustained Emotion: Pain, rage
                    Sustaining belief: That idiot who stepped on my toe shouldn't have done that.
        -Irrational thinking leads to less effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. Yuck! That's disgusting!
            C. Still hungry.
    -Healthy emotions help you achieve what you want in life more effectively and joyfully.
        -Emotions are necessary for survival.
            Example: Your desire to survive will prevent you from swimming too far out to sea.
        -Rational thinking leads to more effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. I don't prefer the bruised part, but the rest is satisfactory.
            C. Not hungry.
        -Healthy emotions help you achieve your goals with more happiness and satisfaction (Chapter 3 contains argument)
    -REBT is your toolkit for observing your unhealthy emotions and remodeling your unhealthy emotions into healthy emotions.
        -Unhealthy emotions are needlessly created, but we lack understanding to see them.
        -REBT enables you to observe your emotions and beliefs and determine their usefulness.
        -Deep-rooted behavior change is possible and requires uprooting irrational beliefs and replacing with rational beliefs.

== Chapter 5: Thinking Yourself Out Of Emotional Disturbances ==

Main Argument: We learned our beliefs and can relearn them with rational thinking and hard work.
    -Your emotional disturbances stem from your learned irrational beliefs.
        -Most continuously negative emotions come from awfulizing. Example:
            A. Your child dies.
            B. How *awful*! She *shouldn't* have died! I *can't stand* it!
            C. Severe depression.
        -You can awfulize about anything (even trivial things).
            Example: Not learning to play violin. Not being a tiddlywinks champion.
        We aren't born with these beliefs. We learn them.
    -What we learn, we can relearn.
        -Sustained negative emotions are our invention and a choice we make.
        -We can choose how we want to think and thus how we feel.
        -We can choose our beliefs such that not much severely disturbs us.
    -We can relearn our beliefs using rational thinking and hard work.
        -Rational thinking helps you observe your beliefs and determine if they are rational or irrational.
        -We can judge our actions instead of our *self*. Judging the *self* invariably leads to self-damnation and unhealthy emotions.
        -We can change if we know how (e.g. using REBT), work hard to observe their irrational beliefs, and choose rational beliefs.

== Chapter 6: Recognizing And Reducing Neurotic Behavior ==

Main Argument: You need insight to recognize and reduce your neurotic behavior.
    -Neurosis stems from irrational thinking.
        -Sensible thinking generally results in healthy emoting.
        -Stupidity, ignorance, and disturbance block clear thinking and lead to overemotional or apathetic feelings.
        -Neurosis stems from a lack of insight.
            -Example: Even for severe abuse, the horrifying reaction to the abuse is a major cause of the trauma (i.e. believing "this *should not* have happened!").
    -Insight No. 1: To clearly recognize a problem and certain events that precede it.
        -Conventional insight popularized by psychoanalysis.
        -Example:
            Context: Naomi wants to become a teacher.
            Problem: She makes no effort to study.
            Insight (partial): She believed this stemmed from her lack of confidence and self-damnation for promiscuity.
            Insight (fuller):
                1. Her lack of confidence comes from telling herself:
                    -"My older sister views me as inadequate. She is right and I can *never* perform adequately".
                2. Her self-damnation comes from telling herself:
                    -"Many people view promiscuity as wicked. I behaved promiscuously. I am *wicked*", and
                    -"Many people believe those that act badly deserve punishment. I acted badly. I *must* punish myself".
    -Insight No. 2: To clearly see that your irrational beliefs persist because you are continuously reindoctrinating yourself.
        -Example: Naomi continuously telling herself: "I *should not* be promiscuous. I *need to* keep punishing myself and *must* cleanse myself".
        -We inevitably self-down and feel depressed if we:
            -believe failure will be *horrible*,
            -believe in our intrinsic worthlessness,
            -and unthinkingly accept others' damning.
    -Irrational beliefs stem from overgeneralizations and are unprovable and unfalsifiable.
        -Irrational beliefs are not absolutely wrong, but are impractical because they are self-defeating and needlessly block our goals.
        -Unprovable and unfalsifiable:
            -Adversity: I didn't get the job.
            -Irrational Belief: This is *awful*.
            -Unhealthy Consequences: Feelings of shame, embarrassment, and depression.
    -Insight No. 3: To clearly see that you must steadily, persistently, and vigorously work to dispute and change your beliefs.
        -You can temporarily distract yourself (e.g. changing jobs, joining a cult, abusing alcohol and drugs), but this will not change your irrational beliefs.
        -Unless you dispute and change your beliefs, you will inevitably return to your neurotic behavior.
        -You can *choose* to unconditionally accept yourself, and only judge your actions in relation to a goal.
        -Provable and falsifiable:
            -Goal: I desire to get this job.
            -Adversity: I didn't get the job.
            -Rational Belief: This is unfortunate.
            -Healthy Consequences: Feelings of disappointment.

== Chapter 7: Overcoming The Influences Of The Past ==

-Difference between _weakness_ and _complex_. Weakness (or inferiority) is compared to a goal or reference (e.g. a person). Complex is self-perception as a weakling and a worthless person for having this weakness. The first is a provable. The second is an overgeneralization of the first and a *conclusion* that is chosen.
-Insight into past is of limited utility since you have changed. You don't even need to understand the past to get Insights 1-3.
-Even in cases of child neglect, it is your irrational beliefs about the rejection that disturb you.
    -Example: Children from rural Eygpt are harshly neglected (by Western standards) yet are not neurotic for lack of love due to societal differences.
-Beliefs rejected children learn:
    1. Your parents *must* show love and approval and they behave *horribly* when they don't
    2. If rejected, you should feel worthless.
    3. If you feel worthless, you have to keep failing at important tasks.
    4. If you fail, you have committed a great crime which again proves your worthlessness.
    5. If you fear failure and don't learn certain things, this shows you have no ability and are worthless.
-Children are born with a strong desire for attachment. Without loving care, they naturally feel sad, lonely and often depressed. Children need considerable love to grow up "normal".
    Example: Harlow's monkeys grew up ineffectual and inadequate in many measurable regards.
-Severe abuse in early life often leads to self-view as inadequate and worthless.
-Self-view develops when your wants are deprived and you feel sad and frustrated. This is healthy and motivates you to improve your circumstances. Yet people (especially children) go beyond healthy emoting when "really" bad things happen. They insist that these bad things *should not*, *must not* exist; and bad conditions will *always* exist and *never* improve*.
-Children learn:
    1. The advantages of "good" behavior and the disadvantages of "bad" behavior.
    2. To be happy about "good" actions and sad about "bad" actions (i.e. they *agree* it is undesirable to act badly).
    3. You *must* do "well" or you are a "bad" child.
    4. To unrealistically overgeneralize:
        -From "I'd prefer" to "I must".
        -From "It is bad if ..." to "I am bad if ..."
-Parental rejection is a severe Adversity, but we are disturbed only when coupled with irrational beliefs.
-Only physical assault or extreme deprivation can severely hurt us.
-Negative words, attitudes, and ideas work though _us_ (i.e. you *choose* to let them affect you).
-Concern for others' regard helps you survive. Extreme lack of concern is disadvantageous. Concern and caution contribute to your enjoyment (e.g. establishing satisfying friendships, finding appropriate partners, sustaining good relationships). Concern aids community welfare (e.g. refraining from littering, driving recklessly, etc)
-Feel concerned and care about your own behavior and its effect on other, but work against feeling *over-concerned* (i.e. anxious).
    -Example (over-concerned):
        -A: Called a liar.
        -B: I *must* have their approval.
        -C: Shame and depression.
    -Example (healthy concern, disagree):
        -A: Called a liar.
        -B: I rarely lie. They are mistaken. How can I show them I seldom lie.
        -C: Motivation to clear your reputation.
    -Example (healthy concern, agree):
        -A: Called a liar.
        -B: I believe they are correct that I have lied. I better stop lying if I want people to trust me.
        -C: Motivation to deal with people truthfully.
-As an adult, you can choose to believe hurtful *or* unhurtful ideas. You have the choice because you _still_ choose to believe the unrealistic and irrational thoughts you originally held.
