A Guide To Rational Living by Albert Ellis

== Chapter 1: How Far Can You Go With Self-Therapy? ==

Main Argument: Self-therapy is a necessary, but rarely sufficient part of behavior change.
    -Self-therapy is limited
        -People misunderstand, distort, and oversimplify presented principles because they read what they _want_ to read.
        -People don't apply the concepts that they learn.
    -Therapy compensates for the pitfalls of self-therapy
        -A trained therapist checks whether a client truly understands the concepts
        -A trained therapist pushes clients to change.
        -A trained therapist is able to adapt the generic concepts to your dynamic life.
    -The book is intended to supplement therapy
        -Gives interested clients something to read.
        -For rare individuals the book will be sufficient for behavior change.


== Chapter 2: You Largely Feel The Way You Think ==

Main Argument: There is considerable evidence that humans feel the way they think.

Exposition:
    -Goals (Gs): To stay alive and be reasonably happy or satisfied:
        (1) by yourself
        (2) in your relationships with people
        (3) by producing and achieving
        (4) by being original and creative
        (5) by enjoying physical, emotional, and mental activities
    -Adversities (As): Events, encounters, experiences, or thoughts that interfere with your goals.
    -Beliefs (Bs): Beliefs, ideas, and philosophies about Adversities.
    -Rational Beliefs (RBs): Preferences and wishes that Adversities do not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I dislike failing at work.
            -I hate when people treat me unfairly.
    -Irrational Beliefs (IBs): Strong demands that Adversities must not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I absolutely must not fail at work and am a worthless person if I do.
            -People must never treat me unfairly and are rotten persons if they do.
    -Consequences (Cs): The result of Adversities and Beliefs.
    -Healthy Consequences (HCs): Constructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of regret or disappointment when you fail at work.
            -Determination and action to improve your skills.
            -Feelings of displeasure and disappointment when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of sadness and regret when you have the flu.
    -Unhealthy Consequences (UCs): Destructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of horror and self-downing when you fail at work.
            -Refusing to improve you skills and look for another job.
            -Feelings of rage and vindictiveness when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of depression and self-pity when you have the flu.

== Chapter 3: Feeling Well By Thinking Straight ==

Main Argument: Rational thinking increases your happiness and helps you achieve your goals.
    -Rational thinking does not entail being an emotionless robot
        -Unfounded societal expectation that getting the "most out of life" comes from highly "emotional" experiences
            -Example: going from deep depression to maniac joy to the bogs of despair
        -Rational thinking proponents still feel sorrow, pain, joy, and elation
        -Healthy emoting is rational and helps you achieve your goals
            -Example: Great desire for love might make you work harder, write poems, etc.
    -Rational thinking increases happiness
        -Rational thinking minimizes unhealthy, self-defeating emotions
        -Pleasant emotions and pursuits surface to the top
        -Unpleasant emotions (e.g. sorrow and regret) are healthy when they are constructive
            -Example: as signals that something has gone wrong and had better be corrected
    -The rational thinking approach is evidence-based
        -Book contains clinical, experimental, and personal evidence
        -You can experiment and try the approach for yourself.

Exposition:
    -Four process responsible for survival and happiness:
        -Senses (sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch)
        -Emotions (love, hate, joy, sadness)
        -Actions (walk, eat, swim, climb, play)
        -Thought (remember, imagine, hypothesis, conclude)
    -Four processes are intertwined:
        -Example 1:
            1. Sense: See an apple
            2. Emotion: Desirable or not?
            3. Thought: Useful or not?
            4. Action: Pick it up or throw away?
        -Example 2:
            1. Action: Pick up a stick
            2. Sense: See yourself holding stick
            3. Thought: Consider what to do with stick
            4. Emotion: Like or dislike stick
        -Example 3:
            -Limited: "Jones thinks about the puzzle"
            -Comprehensive: "Jones perceives-moves-emotes-and-thinks about the puzzle"
    -Considerable progress using technology to advance:
        -Senses (e.g. glasses, radar)
        -Actions (e.g. bicycles, aircrafts)
        -Thought (e.g. computers)
    -Emotional maturity and happiness are largely unchanged compared to past centuries

== Chapter 4: How You Create Your Feelings ==

Main Argument: REBT enables you to observe your feelings, determine their usefulness, and eventually choose how you want to feel and what will help you achieve what you want in life.
    -Unhealthy emotions stem from irrational beliefs and sabotage your goals and happiness
        -Unhealthy emotions come from irrational beliefs.
            -Example:
                A. Someone interviewing for a job.
                B. Suppose I make a fool of myself ... that would be *awful*.
                C. Depression and rage (This is awful! I would be an idiot!)
        -Irrational beliefs sustain negative emotions.
            Example: Someone steps on your toe.
                Immediate Emotion: Pain, anger
                Sustained Emotion: Pain, rage
                    Sustaining belief: That idiot who stepped on my toe shouldn't have done that.
        -Irrational thinking leads to less effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. Yuck! That's disgusting!
            C. Still hungry.
    -Healthy emotions help you achieve what you want in life more effectively and joyfully.
        -Emotions are necessary for survival.
            Example: Your desire to survive will prevent you from swimming too far out to sea.
        -Rational thinking leads to more effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. I don't prefer the bruised part, but the rest is satisfactory.
            C. Not hungry.
        -Healthy emotions help you achieve your goals with more happiness and satisfaction (Chapter 3 contains argument)
    -REBT is your toolkit for observing your unhealthy emotions and remodeling your unhealthy emotions into healthy emotions.
        -Unhealthy emotions are needlessly created, but we lack understanding to see them.
        -REBT enables you to observe your emotions and beliefs and determine their usefulness.
        -Deep-rooted behavior change is possible and requires uprooting irrational beliefs and replacing with rational beliefs.

== Chapter 5: Thinking Yourself Out Of Emotional Disturbances ==

Main Argument: We learned our beliefs and can relearn them with rational thinking and hard work.
    -Your emotional disturbances stem from your learned irrational beliefs.
        -Most continuously negative emotions come from awfulizing. Example:
            A. Your child dies.
            B. How *awful*! She *shouldn't* have died! I *can't stand* it!
            C. Severe depression.
        -You can awfulize about anything (even trivial things).
            Example: Not learning to play violin. Not being a tiddlywinks champion.
        We aren't born with these beliefs. We learn them.
    -What we learn, we can relearn.
        -Sustained negative emotions are our invention and a choice we make.
        -We can choose how we want to think and thus how we feel.
        -We can choose our beliefs such that not much severely disturbs us.
    -We can relearn our beliefs using rational thinking and hard work.
        -Rational thinking helps you observe your beliefs and determine if they are rational or irrational.
        -We can judge our actions instead of our *self*. Judging the *self* invariably leads to self-damnation and unhealthy emotions.
        -We can change if we know how (e.g. using REBT), work hard to observe their irrational beliefs, and choose rational beliefs.

== Chapter 6: Recognizing And Reducing Neurotic Behavior ==

Main Argument: You need insight to recognize and reduce your neurotic behavior.
    -Neurosis stems from irrational thinking.
        -Sensible thinking generally results in healthy emoting.
        -Stupidity, ignorance, and disturbance block clear thinking and lead to overemotional or apathetic feelings.
        -Neurosis stems from a lack of insight.
            -Example: Even for severe abuse, the horrifying reaction to the abuse is a major cause of the trauma (i.e. believing "this *should not* have happened!").
    -Insight No. 1: To clearly recognize a problem and certain events that precede it.
        -Conventional insight popularized by psychoanalysis.
        -Example:
            Context: Naomi wants to become a teacher.
            Problem: She makes no effort to study.
            Insight (partial): She believed this stemmed from her lack of confidence and self-damnation for promiscuity.
            Insight (fuller):
                1. Her lack of confidence comes from telling herself:
                    -"My older sister views me as inadequate. She is right and I can *never* perform adequately".
                2. Her self-damnation comes from telling herself:
                    -"Many people view promiscuity as wicked. I behaved promiscuously. I am *wicked*", and
                    -"Many people believe those that act badly deserve punishment. I acted badly. I *must* punish myself".
    -Insight No. 2: To clearly see that your irrational beliefs persist because you are continuously reindoctrinating yourself.
        -Example: Naomi continuously telling herself: "I *should not* be promiscuous. I *need to* keep punishing myself and *must* cleanse myself".
        -We inevitably self-down and feel depressed if we:
            -believe failure will be *horrible*,
            -believe in our intrinsic worthlessness,
            -and unthinkingly accept others' damning.
    -Irrational beliefs stem from overgeneralizations and are unprovable and unfalsifiable.
        -Irrational beliefs are not absolutely wrong, but are impractical because they are self-defeating and needlessly block our goals.
        -Unprovable and unfalsifiable:
            -Adversity: I didn't get the job.
            -Irrational Belief: This is *awful*.
            -Unhealthy Consequences: Feelings of shame, embarrassment, and depression.
    -Insight No. 3: To clearly see that you must steadily, persistently, and vigorously work to dispute and change your beliefs.
        -You can temporarily distract yourself (e.g. changing jobs, joining a cult, abusing alcohol and drugs), but this will not change your irrational beliefs.
        -Unless you dispute and change your beliefs, you will inevitably return to your neurotic behavior.
        -You can *choose* to unconditionally accept yourself, and only judge your actions in relation to a goal.
        -Provable and falsifiable:
            -Goal: I desire to get this job.
            -Adversity: I didn't get the job.
            -Rational Belief: This is unfortunate.
            -Healthy Consequences: Feelings of disappointment.

== Chapter 7: Overcoming The Influences Of The Past ==

Main Argument: Despite your childhood abuse, you can *choose* healthy or unhealthy beliefs.
    -Childhood abuse is a severe Adversity.
        -Psychoanalytic insight into your past is of limited utility since:
            -Your *original* context no longer exists (i.e. you have changed as a person).
            -Your recalled memories are of questionable accuracy.
            -You need Insight into your *present* and *still-existing* beliefs.
        -Your irrational beliefs related to your childhood are what cause your disturbance.
            -Example: Children from rural Eygpt are harshly neglected (by Western standards) yet are not neurotic for lack of love due to societal differences.
        -Irrational beliefs rejected children learn:
            1. Your parents *must* show love and approval and they behave *horribly* when they don't
            2. If rejected, you should feel worthless.
            3. If you feel worthless, you have to keep failing at important tasks.
            4. If you fail, you have committed a great crime which again proves your worthlessness.
            5. If you fear failure and don't learn certain things, this shows you have no ability and are worthless.
    -Childhood abuse often leads to developing a self-view of inadequacy and worthlessness.
        -Children are born with a strong desire for attachment and, without loving care, they naturally feel sad, lonely and often depressed.
            Example: Harlow's monkeys grew up ineffectual and inadequate in many measurable regards.
        -Children naturally overgeneralize and learn:
            1. The advantages of "good" behavior and the disadvantages of "bad" behavior.
            2. To be happy about "good" actions and sad about "bad" actions (i.e. they *agree* it is undesirable to act badly).
            3. That you *must* do "well" or you are a "bad" child.
            4. To unrealistically overgeneralize:
                -From "I'd prefer" to "I must".
                -From "It is bad if ..." to "I am bad if ..."
        -A self-view of inadequacy and worthlessness develops when:
            A. You are badly neglected and your desires are deprived.
            B. You insist that bad things *must not* exist; and that bad conditions will *always* exist and *never* improve.
            C. First, you feel sorry and determined to improve themselves. Second, you feel depressed and hopeless and determined to whine, give up, and make things worse.
    -You can choose to choose to believe *hurtful* or *unhurtful* ideas.
        -Negative words, attitudes, and ideas work through us (i.e. you *choose* to let them affect you).
            -Only physical assault or extreme deprivation can directly hurt us.
        -You can choose your beliefs because you *still* choose to believe the unrealistic and irrational thoughts you originally held.
        -Concern and caution are healthy emotions and contribute to your enjoyment.
            Example: Concern helps you establish satisfying friendships, find appropriate partners, etc.
            Example: Concern aids refraining from littering, driving recklessly, etc.
        -Over-concern and under-concern of others' regard are both disadvantageous.
            -Example (over-concerned):
                -A: Called a liar.
                -B: I *must* have their approval.
                -C: Shame and depression.
            -Example (healthy concern, disagree):
                -A: Called a liar.
                -B: I rarely lie. They are mistaken. How can I show them I seldom lie.
                -C: Motivation to clear your reputation.
            -Example (healthy concern, agree):
                -A: Called a liar.
                -B: I believe they are correct that I have lied. I better stop lying if I want people to trust me.
                -C: Motivation to deal with people truthfully.

== Chapter 8: Is Reason Always Reasonable? ==

Main Argument: Rational emotive thinking is a framework to experimentally discover what is sensible, efficient, and unself-defeating for *you*.
    -Humans rarely behave rationally.
        -Although humans are far brighter than higher apes, they still have strong tendencies to act in prejudiced and ineffectual ways.
            -Example: The story of Marlo, an unusually intelligent and attractive young woman.
                -Despite only graduating from high school, she quickly rose to the most responsible secretarial position at work.
                -Despite career success, she tried to kill herself after an older man refused to divorce his current wife and then marry Marlo.
                -Irrational belief:
                    -If a lover disapproves of me, then I am worthless.
                    -If I am worthless, then my lovers will disapprove of me.
                    -This is the circular reasoning fallacy (i.e. A → B ∧ B → A).
        -Humans rarely outgrow their early childhood behavior of dependency and irrationality.
        -Even after clearly seeing their own self-defeating ways, we still have great difficulty achieving sound and sane behavior.
    -There is no absolutely good or certain standard of living.
        -It is impossible to perfectly resolve remaining yourself while simultaneously getting along with others.
            -Example: Imagine talking with a group of friends.
                -If you talk about your interests, then you might bore or upset by "hogging the floor".
                -If you completely go along, then you might sit in pained silence.
                -If you express strong views, then you might hurt or insult.
                -If you withhold or cautiously express strong views, you might frustrate yourself.
        -There is no universal demarcation between reasonable and unreasonable behavior.
            -Example:
                -If you only live for today, then you are sabotaging your longer term interests.
                -If you only live for tomorrow, then you might live an overcautious and dull life.
                -If you are over-concerned with the regard of others, then you might bend over backwards for others but see yourself as weak.
                -If you are under-concerned with the regard of others and run roughshod over them, then people might thwart you.
    -REBT is a framework to experimentally increase your happiness and reduce your unhealthy emotions.
        -You can use REBT to experimentally discover what is sensible, efficient, and unself-defeating for *you*.
            -Since there is no universal standard of conduct, what is rational and unself-defeating depends on your goals.
        -REBT advocates a highly reasoned approach to life, but not rationalizing or intellectualizing.
            -Rationalizing: Justifying your actions, beliefs, and desires with ostensibly rational explanations.
                -This excusing of your behavior is the opposite of thinking rationally. 
            -Intellectualizing: Overemphasizing intellectual pursuits.
                -This approach results in you compulsively denying and avoiding your emotions.
