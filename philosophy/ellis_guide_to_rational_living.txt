A Guide To Rational Living by Albert Ellis

== Chapter 1: How Far Can You Go With Self-Therapy? ==

Main Argument: Self-therapy is a necessary, but rarely sufficient part of behavior change.
    -Self-therapy is limited
        -People misunderstand, distort, and oversimplify presented principles because they read what they _want_ to read.
        -People don't apply the concepts that they learn.
    -Therapy compensates for the pitfalls of self-therapy
        -A trained therapist checks whether a client truly understands the concepts
        -A trained therapist pushes clients to change.
        -A trained therapist is able to adapt the generic concepts to your dynamic life.
    -The book is intended to supplement therapy
        -Gives interested clients something to read.
        -For rare individuals the book will be sufficient for behavior change.


== Chapter 2: You Largely Feel The Way You Think ==

Main Argument: There is considerable evidence that humans feel the way they think.

Exposition:
    -Goals (Gs): To stay alive and be reasonably happy or satisfied:
        (1) by yourself
        (2) in your relationships with people
        (3) by producing and achieving
        (4) by being original and creative
        (5) by enjoying physical, emotional, and mental activities
    -Adversities (As): Events, encounters, experiences, or thoughts that interfere with your goals.
    -Beliefs (Bs): Beliefs, ideas, and philosophies about Adversities.
    -Rational Beliefs (RBs): Preferences and wishes that Adversities do not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I dislike failing at work.
            -I hate when people treat me unfairly.
    -Irrational Beliefs (IBs): Strong demands that Adversities must not occur.
        -Examples:
            -I absolutely must not fail at work and am a worthless person if I do.
            -People must never treat me unfairly and are rotten persons if they do.
    -Consequences (Cs): The result of Adversities and Beliefs.
    -Healthy Consequences (HCs): Constructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of regret or disappointment when you fail at work.
            -Determination and action to improve your skills.
            -Feelings of displeasure and disappointment when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of sadness and regret when you have the flu.
    -Unhealthy Consequences (UCs): Destructive feelings and behavior stemming from the interaction of Adversities and Beliefs.
        -Examples:
            -Feelings of horror and self-downing when you fail at work.
            -Refusing to improve you skills and look for another job.
            -Feelings of rage and vindictiveness when treated unfairly.
            -Feelings of depression and self-pity when you have the flu.

== Chapter 3: Feeling Well By Thinking Straight ==

Main Argument: Rational thinking increases your happiness and helps you achieve your goals.
    -Rational thinking does not entail being an emotionless robot
        -Unfounded societal expectation that getting the "most out of life" comes from highly "emotional" experiences
            -Example: going from deep depression to maniac joy to the bogs of despair
        -Rational thinking proponents still feel sorrow, pain, joy, and elation
        -Healthy emoting is rational and helps you achieve your goals
            -Example: Great desire for love might make you work harder, write poems, etc.
    -Rational thinking increases happiness
        -Rational thinking minimizes unhealthy, self-defeating emotions
        -Pleasant emotions and pursuits surface to the top
        -Unpleasant emotions (e.g. sorrow and regret) are healthy when they are constructive
            -Example: as signals that something has gone wrong and had better be corrected
    -The rational thinking approach is evidence-based
        -Book contains clinical, experimental, and personal evidence
        -You can experiment and try the approach for yourself.

Exposition:
    -Four process responsible for survival and happiness:
        -Senses (sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch)
        -Emotions (love, hate, joy, sadness)
        -Actions (walk, eat, swim, climb, play)
        -Thought (remember, imagine, hypothesis, conclude)
    -Four processes are intertwined:
        -Example 1:
            1. Sense: See an apple
            2. Emotion: Desirable or not?
            3. Thought: Useful or not?
            4. Action: Pick it up or throw away?
        -Example 2:
            1. Action: Pick up a stick
            2. Sense: See yourself holding stick
            3. Thought: Consider what to do with stick
            4. Emotion: Like or dislike stick
        -Example 3:
            -Limited: "Jones thinks about the puzzle"
            -Comprehensive: "Jones perceives-moves-emotes-and-thinks about the puzzle"
    -Considerable progress using technology to advance:
        -Senses (e.g. glasses, radar)
        -Actions (e.g. bicycles, aircrafts)
        -Thought (e.g. computers)
    -Emotional maturity and happiness are largely unchanged compared to past centuries

== Chapter 4: How You Create Your Feelings ==

Main Argument: REBT enables you to observe your feelings, determine their usefulness, and eventually choose how you want to feel and what will help you achieve what you want in life.
    -Unhealthy emotions stem from irrational beliefs and sabotage your goals and happiness
        -Unhealthy emotions come from irrational beliefs.
            -Example:
                A. Someone interviewing for a job.
                B. Suppose I make a fool of myself ... that would be *awful*.
                C. Depression and rage (This is awful! I would be an idiot!)
        -Irrational beliefs sustain negative emotions.
            Example: Someone steps on your toe.
                Immediate Emotion: Pain, anger
                Sustained Emotion: Pain, rage
                    Sustaining belief: That idiot who stepped on my toe shouldn't have done that.
        -Irrational thinking leads to less effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. Yuck! That's disgusting!
            C. Still hungry.
    -Healthy emotions help you achieve what you want in life more effectively and joyfully.
        -Emotions are necessary for survival.
            Example: Your desire to survive will prevent you from swimming too far out to sea.
        -Rational thinking leads to more effective decisions.
            A. Someone is hungry and sees a partially bruised apple.
            B. I don't prefer the bruised part, but the rest is satisfactory.
            C. Not hungry.
        -Healthy emotions help you achieve your goals with more happiness and satisfaction (Chapter 3 contains argument)
    -REBT is your toolkit for observing your unhealthy emotions and remodeling your unhealthy emotions into healthy emotions.
        -Unhealthy emotions are needlessly created, but we lack understanding to see them.
        -REBT enables you to observe your emotions and beliefs and determine their usefulness.
        -Deep-rooted behavior change is possible and requires uprooting irrational beliefs and replacing with rational beliefs.

== Chapter 5: Thinking Yourself Out Of Emotional Disturbances ==

Main Argument: We learned our beliefs and can relearn them with rational thinking and hard work.
    -Your emotional disturbances stem from your learned irrational beliefs.
        -Most continuously negative emotions come from awfulizing. Example:
            A. Your child dies.
            B. How *Awful*! She *shouldn't* have died! I *can't stand* it!
            C. Severe depression.
        -You can awfulize about anything (even trivial things).
            Example: Not learning to play violin. Not being a tiddlywinks champion.
        We aren't born with these beliefs. We learn them.
    -What we learn, we can relearn.
        -Sustained negative emotions are our invention and a choice we make.
        -We can choose how we want to think and thus how we feel.
        -We can choose our beliefs such that not much severely disturbs us.
    -We can relearn our beliefs using rational thinking and hard work.
        -Rational thinking helps you observe your beliefs and determine if they are rational or irrational.
        -We can judge our actions instead of our *self*. Judging the *self* invariably leads to self-damnation and unhealthy emotions.
        -We can change if we know how (e.g. using REBT), work hard to observe their irrational beliefs, and choose rational beliefs.
