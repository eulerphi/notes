p = true, q = false


math: what is the order of evaluation for "p ∨ q → r"?
(p ∨ q) → r


math: when is something vacuously true?
When a statement is meaninglessly true (e.g. if the moon is made of cheese, then I am a billionaire)


math: p → q ≡ ...?
~p ∨ q


math: ~(p → q) ≡ ...?
p ∧ ~q

Sara lives in Athens and does not live in Greece


math: p → q ≡ ... (contrapositive)?
~q → ~p

If tomorrow is not Monday then today is not Easter


math: p → q ≡ ... (converse)?
q → p


math: what is the converse of "If today is Easter then tomorrow is Monday"?
If tomorrow is Monday then today is Easter


math: p → q ≡ ... (inverse)?
~p → ~q


math: what is the inverse of "If today is Easter then tomorrow is Monday"?

math: what does "p only if q" mean?
~q → ~p


math: what does "John will break the record only if he runs < 4 min/mile" mean?
If John does not run < 4 min/mile, then he will not break record


math: what does "p ↔ q" mean?
p if, and only if, q


math: how to write the biconditional of p and q?
p ↔ q


math: when is "p ↔ q" true?
when both are true or false


math: how to write "p if, and only if, q"?
p ↔ q


math: how to abbreviate "if and only if"?
iff


math: p ↔ q ≡ ...(with conditional)?
(p → q) ∧ (q → p)


math: what is the order of evaluation for "p → q ↔ r"?
Ambigious. → and ↔ are coequal in order


math: p ↔ q ≡ ... (without conditional)?
(~p ∨ q) ∧ (~q ∨ p)


math: what does "r is a sufficient condition for s" mean?
if r then s


math: what does "r is a necessary condition for s" mean?
if not r then not s


math: what does "r is a necessary and sufficient condition for s" mean?
r if, and only if, s


math: what is the logical form of "Pia's birth on U.S. soil is a sufficient condition to be a U.S. citizen"?
If (Pia was born on U.S. soil) then (she is a U.S. citizen)


math: what is the logical form of "George attaining age 35 is necessary condition for his being president of U.S."?
