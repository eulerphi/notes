Epp 3.1 Elementary Number Theory and Methods of Proof

math: Is 1 prime?
No. Primes are > 1.


math: What is the parity of 0?
Even. 0 = 0 · 2


math: What is the parity of -61?
Odd. -61 = 2 (-30) + 1

math: Suppose a, b ∈ Z, what is the parity of:
    10a + 8b + 1
Odd. 2 (5a + 4b) + 1


math: Suppose n is prime,
    ∀ r, s ∈ Z, n = r · s → r ...
r = 1 ∨ s = 1


math: Suppose n is composite,
    ∃ r, s ∈ Z, n = r · s → r ...
r ≠ 1 ∧ s ≠ 1


math: When is the following true:
    ∃ x ∈ D | Q(x)
Q(x) for at least one x in D


math: What is a constructive proof of existence?
To prove an existential statement by finding a domain element that satisfies the property


math: What is a nonconstructive proof of existence?
To prove an existential statement by showing that assuming otherwise leads to contradiction


math: What is the method of exhaustion?
To prove a universal statement by showing that all domain elements satisfy the property


math: What is the method of direct proof?
To prove a universal statement by showing that any particular but arbitrary domain element satisfies the property


math: What are the steps of a direct proof?
1.) Rewrite statement as ∀ x ∈ D, P(x) → Q(x)
2.) Suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen domain element
3.) Suppose P(s)
4.) Prove Q(x)


math: What does "begging the question" mean?
A logical fallacy where the truth of the conclusion is assumed.


math: How to disprove:
    ∀ x ∈ D, P(x) → Q(x)
Find x such that P(x) and ~Q(x)
