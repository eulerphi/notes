Logical Form and Logical Equivalence

Who wrote the first great treatises on logic?
Aristotle


What is the central concept in deductive logic?
The argument form


math: what is argument form?
A sequence of abstract statements that necessarily follow from preceding statements


math: what is a statement?
A sentence that is true or false but not both


math: Is "he is a college student" a statement?
No. The sentence is neither true nor false


math: convert "he is a college student" into a statement
Clarify who "he" is


math: what does "~p" mean?
Not p


math: how to write the logical negation of p?
~p


math: what does "p ^ q" mean?
p and q


math: how to write the conjunction of p and q?
p ∨ q


math: what does "p V q" mean?
p or q


math: how to write the disjunction of p and q?
p ∨ q


math: what is the order of evaluation for "~p ^ q"?
(~p) ^ q


math: what is the order of evaluation for "p ^ q ∨ r" mean?
Ambigious. ^ and ∨ are coequal in order


math: what is a compound statement?
A statement composed of other statements using connectives (e.g. ^, ∨, ->)


math: what is the logical form of "it is not hot but not sunny"?
(it is not hot) ∧ (it is sunny)


math: what is the logical form of "it is neither hot nor sunny"?
(it is not hot) ∧ ~(it is not sunny)


math: what is the Logical form of "x <= a"?
(x < a) V (x = a)


math: what is the logical form of "a <= x <= b"?
(a ≤ x) ∧ (x ≤ b)


math: when is the conjunction of p and q true?
When p and q are both true


math: when is the disjunction of p and q false?
When p and q are both false


math: what is a tautology?
A statement or form that is always true regardless of statement variables.


math: what does the symbol "t" mean?
Tautology


math: what is a contradiction?
A statement or form that is always false regardless of statement variables.


math: what does the symbol "c" mean?
Contradiction


math: ~(~p) ≡ ... (double negative law)?
p


math: ~(p ∨ q) ≡ ... (De Morgan's law)?
~p ∧ ~q


math: ~p ∧ ~q ≡ ... (De Morgan's law)?
~(p ∨ q)


math: ~(p ∧ q) ≡ ... (De Morgan's law)? 
~p ∨ ~q 


math: ~p ∨ ~q ≡ ... (De Morgan's law)?
~(p ∧ q) 


math: p ∧ q ≡ ... (commutative law)?
q ∧ p


math: p ∨ q ≡ ... (commutative law)?
q ∨ p


math: (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ ... (associative law)?
p ∧ (q ∧ r)


math: (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ ... (associative law)?
p ∨ (q ∨ r)


math: p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ ... (distributive law)?
(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)


math: (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) ≡ ... (distributive law)?
p ∧ (q ∨ r)


math: p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ ... (distributive law)?
(p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)


math: (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) ≡ ... (distributive law)?
p ∨ (q ∧ r)


math: p ∧ t ≡ ... (identity law)?
p


math: p ∨ c ≡ ... (identity law)?
p


math: p ∨ ~p ≡ ... (negation law)?
t


math: p ∧ ~p ≡ ... (negation law)?
c


math: p ∧ p ≡ ... (idempotent law)?
p


math: p ∨ p ≡ ... (idempotent law)?
p


math: p ∨ t ≡ ... (univeral bound law)?
t


math: p ∨ c ≡ ... (univeral bound law)?
c


math: p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ ... (absorption law)?
p


math: p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ ... (absorption law)?
