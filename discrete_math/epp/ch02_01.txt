Epp 2.1 The Logic of Quantified Statements

math: what is a predicate?
A template sentence that takes a finite number of variables to become a statement


math: What does "R" mean?
The set of all real numbers


math: What does "Z" mean?
The set of all integer numbers


math: What does "Q" mean?
The set of all rational numbers


math: What does "∈" mean?
element of a set


math: What does "x ∈ Z⁺" mean?
x is a positive integer


math: What does "x ∈ Q⁻" mean?
x is a positive integer


math: What does "∀" mean?
For all


math: ∀ is the ... quantifier
universal


math: What is the form of a universal statement?
∀x ∈ D, Q(x)


math: When is a universal statement false?
∃x ∈ D, ~Q(x)


math: What is the method of exhaustion?
To show the truth of a predicate for all domain elements


math: what does "∃" mean?
there exists


math: ∃ is the ... quantifier
existential


math: What is the form of an existential statement?
∃x ∈ D, Q(x)


math: When is an existential statement false?
∀x ∈ D, ~Q(x)


math: Restate informally:
    ∀x ∈ Z, x² ≥ 0
All integers have nonnegative squares


math: Restate informally:
    ∃x ∈ Z, x² = x
Some integer equals its square


math: Restate formally:
    No dogs have wings
∀ dogs d, d does not have wings


math: Restate formally:
    Some programs are structured
∃ program p, p is structured


math: What is the form of the universal conditional statement?
∀x, P(x) → Q(x)


math: Restate informally:
    Vx ∈ R, (x > 2) → (x² > 4)
If a real number is greater than 2, thens its square is greater than 4


math:
