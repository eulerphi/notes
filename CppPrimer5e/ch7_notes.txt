Chapter 7: Classes


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    inline int get_value() { return 42; }
  };
inline is extraneous (functions defined in classes are implicitly inline).


What is the default type of this?
T *const


How to decalre a const member function?
struct Foo {
  int get_value() const { /* */ }
};


How to explicitly define a synthesized default constructor?
struct Foo {
  Foo() = default;
};


How to make a class function inline?
1. Define function body in class
2. Mark class declaration as inline (external definition does not need to be marked)
3. Mark external definition as inline (class declaration does not need to be marked)
4. Mark both class declaration and external definition (extraneous)


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    mutable size_t counter;
    public:
      void function() const { ++counter; }
  };
This is legal (mutable data members can be modified in const functions).


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    int value;
    Foo add(int x) { value += x; return *this; } };
  Foo f; f.add(3).add(5);
  cout << f.value;
f.value == 3. The add(5) is called on a copy of f.


How to declare a class without defining it?
class Foo;


What functionality is supported on forward declared classes?
We can define pointers or references to such types, and we can declare (but not define) functions that use the type as a parameter or return type.


How to designate a class as a friend?
class T { friend class U; };


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    typedef size_t size;
    size set(size);
  };
  Foo::size Foo::moo(size value) { /* */ }
Correct. Foo is in scope at the start of the parameter list.


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    typedef size_t size;
    size set(size);
  };
  size Foo::moo(size value) { /* */ }
Error. The return type size requires Foo:: scope.

What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    typedef size_t size;
    size set(size value);
  };
  auto Foo::set(size value) -> size { /* */ }
Correct. The return type size is in the Foo:: scope.


What is the behavior of the following:
  typedef double Money;
  class Foo {
    public: Money get() { return 0; }
    private: typedef int Money;
  };
Illegal but generally compiles.


What is the return value of get?
  struct Foo {
    int get(int height) { return height; }
    private: int height = 0;
  };
The value of the height argument.

How to return the global max value?
  int max = 42;
  struct Foo {
    int get_max() { return max; }
    private: int max = 50;
  }
Change "return max;" to "return ::max;".


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    size get();
    typedef int size;
  };
Error. size is undefined.


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    const int ci;
    public: Foo() { ci = 1; } };
Error. ci must be initialized and cannot be assigned to.


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    int i; int j;
    public: Foo(int val) : j(val), i(j) { } };
Undefined. Members are initialized in class definition order.


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<int> xs();
  xs.push_back(1);
Error. xs is a function. Change to "vector<int> xs" to use the default ctor.


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo { Foo(string s) { /* */ } };
  Foo f = "Hello";
Correct. A single argument ctor is a converting ctor and defines an implicit conversion.


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo { Foo(string s) { /* */ } };
  void func(Foo f) { /* */ }
  func("Hello");
Error. Only one class-type conversion is applied. Either would work:
1. func(string("Hello"));
2. func(Foo("Hello"));

How to suppress implicit converting constructor?
  struct Foo {
    Foo(string s); };
Change ctor to "explicit Foo(string s);"


What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo { explicit Foo(string s) { } };
  Foo f = "Hello";
Error. Cannot implicitly convert char* to Foo.


How to declare a private static member?
class Foo {
  static int value;
};

How to define value to 42?
  class Foo {
    static int value;
  };
int Foo::value = 42;


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    static Foo f;
  }
Correct. Although Foo is an incomplete, f is ok since it is static.

What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    Foo f;
  }
Error. Foo is an incomplete type. Nonstatic data members can only be pointers or references.

What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    void process(int = value);
    private: static int value;
  };
Correct. Static data members may be used as default arguments.

What is the behavior of the following:
  struct Foo {
    void process(int = value);
    private: int value;
  };
Error. Only static data members may be used as default arguments.


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    static int value = 42;
  };
Error. In-class initialization of static members only supported for const integral types.


What is the behavior of the following:
  class Foo {
    static const string value = "Hello";
  };
Error. In-class initialization of static members only supported for const integral types.
