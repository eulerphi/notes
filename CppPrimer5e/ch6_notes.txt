Chapter 6


In what order are function arguments evaluated?
Compiler-dependent (no guarenteed order).


What are automatic objects?
Objects that exist only while a block is executing.


When is cnt initialized?
  int fun() {
    static int cnt = 0;
    return cnt++;
  }
Local static objects are initialized before the first call to the containing function.


What is the lifetime of cnt?
  int fun() {
    static int cnt = 0;
    return cnt++;
  }
Local static objects are destroyed when the program terminates.


What is the value of cnt?
  int fun() {
    static int cnt;
    return cnt++;
  }
Local static objects are value initialized (i.e. is initialized to 0).


What are the advantages and disadvantages char&?
  int find(char &c) {
    return 0;
  }
Advantage: pass by reference instead of pass by value. Disadvantage: Cannot use temporary objects, e.g. find('a')
