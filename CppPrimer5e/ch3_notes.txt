What is the value of s1:
  string s1;
Default initialization; s1 is empty


What is the value of s2:
  string s1;
  string s2 = s1;
s2 is a copy of s1


What is the value of s3:
  string s3 = "hello";
s3 is a copy of the string literal


What is the value of s4:
  string s4(10, 'c');
s4 is cccccccccc


How to check is a string is empty?
s.empty();


How to get a string's length?
s.size();


What is the behavior of the following:
  string s1 = "hello", s2 = "Hello";
  auto is_gte = s1 >= s2;
is_gtr == false. The comparison is case-sensitive and uses dictionary ordering.


What is the behavior of the following:
  string s1, s2;
  cin >> s1 >> s2; // input: "     Hello World!    "
  cout << s1 << s2 << endl;
Output: "HelloWorld!". The leading and trailing whitespace is ignored and the space between words is used for deliminate


What is the value of line:
  string line;
  getline(cin, line); // input: "  Hello, World!  \n"
line == "  Hello, World!  " // newline is discarded


What is the return type of string::size()?
string::size_type


What is the value of flag:
  int n = -42;
  auto flag = s.size() < n; // s is a string
flag will likely be true. n will be converted to unsigned int (because string::size_type is unsigned)
