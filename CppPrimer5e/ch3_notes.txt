Chapter 3


How to use a name from a namespace without qualifying the name?
using namespace std; // entire namespace
using std::cin; // specific object


Can headers include using statements?
Yes, but it is best avoided to prevent unexpected name conflicts.


What is the value of s1:
  string s1;
Default initialization; s1 is empty


What is the value of s2:
  string s1;
  string s2 = s1;
s2 is a copy of s1


What is the value of s3:
  string s3 = "hello";
s3 is a copy of the string literal


What is the value of s4:
  string s4(10, 'c');
s4 is cccccccccc


How to check is a string is empty?
s.empty();


How to get a string's length?
s.size();


What is the behavior of the following:
  string s1 = "hello", s2 = "Hello";
  auto is_gte = s1 >= s2;
is_gtr == false. The comparison is case-sensitive and uses dictionary ordering.


What is the behavior of the following:
  string s1, s2;
  cin >> s1 >> s2; // input: "     Hello World!    "
  cout << s1 << s2 << endl;
Output: "HelloWorld!". The leading and trailing whitespace is ignored and the space between words is used for deliminate


What is the value of line:
  string line;
  getline(cin, line); // input: "  Hello, World!  \n"
line == "  Hello, World!  " // newline is discarded


What is the return type of string::size()?
string::size_type


What is the value of flag:
  int n = -42;
  auto flag = s.size() < n; // s is a string
flag will likely be true. n will be converted to unsigned int (because string::size_type is unsigned)


How to print out every char of a string?

What header defines functions to classify and transform individual characters?
#include <cctype>


How to check if a char is alphanumeric?
isalnum(c);

iscntrl(c)?


How to check if a char is numeric?
isdigit(c);


How to check if a char is lowercase?
islower(c);


How to check if a char is uppercase?
isupper(c);


How to check if a char is whitespace?
isspace(c);


How to convert a char to lowercase?
tolower(c);


How to convert a char to uppercase?
toupper(c);


How to change convert every char in a string to uppercase?
for (auto &c : str)
  c = toupper(c);


What is the behavior of the following:
  string s = "Hello, World";
  auto c = s[-1];
Undefined. The -1 is converted to string::size_type (which is unsigned).


What is the behavior of the following:
  for (auto c : str)
    c = toupper(c);
c is a copy and only the copy will be updated.


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<string&> list;
Error. Cannot have vector of references (references are not objects)


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<int> iv = {1, 2, 3};
  vector<int> iv2(iv);
iv is lis initialized with items 1,2,3. iv2 is initialized with a copy of the items in iv


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<int> iv;
  vector<string> sv(iv);
Error. Template types must match.


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<string> sv(5, "hi!");
sv is initialized with 5 strings; each item is "hi!"


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<int> iv(10);
iv is initialized with 10 items; each item is value initialized (i.e. initialized to 0)


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<SomeClass> v(5);
It depends on whether SomeClass has a default ctor. If not, then error.


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<string> v{10};
v has ten default-initialized strings; equivalent to v(10).


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<string> v{10, "hi"};
v has ten items with value "hi"; equivalent to v(10, "hi")


How to add an element to a vector?
v.push_back(item);


How to add [0, 9] to a vector?
vector<int> v;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
  v.push_back(i);


How to store a list of ints from cin?
vector<int> v;
int i;
while (cin >> i)
  v.push_back(i);


What is the return type of vector<T>::size()?
vector<T>::size_type


What are the values of b and e?
  vector<int> v{1, 2, 3};
  auto b = v.begin(), e = v.end();
b is positioned at the first item in v, e is positioned one past the end of v.


What is the value of v?
  vector<int> v;
  auto b = v.begin();
b is an off-the-end iterator (v is empty)


How to uppercase each char in a string with iterators?
string s("hi");
for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); ++it)
  *it = toupper(*it);


How to a const iterator to beginning and end of container?
auto b = container.cbegin(), e = container.cend();


What is the value of n?
  string s("hello");
  auto n = s.cend() - s.cbegin();
5. Subtracting iterators yields the number that must be added to the rhs to get the lhs.

What is the value of flag?
  string s("za");
  bool flag = s.cbegin() < ++s.cbegin();
True. Relational operator on iterators compare position in the container.


How to get an iterator to the midpoint of a container?
auto mid = container.begin() + container.size() / 2;


What is the return type of subtracting to iterators?
difference_type (a signed integral type)


How to binary search using iterators?
auto b = v.begin(), e = v.end(), m = b + (e - b)/2;
while (m != e && *m != sought) {
  if (sought < *m) e = m;
  else b = m + 1;
  m = b + (e - b)/2;
}


What are the values of arr?
  int arr[10];
Ten default initialized ints (i.e. uninitialized ints when defined in a function)


What is the behavior of the followng:
  unsigned n = 42;
  int arr[n];
Error. Array dimension must be a constant expression (i.e. constexpr unsigned n = 42)


What is the behavior of the following:
  int arr[10] = {};
The items in arr are value initialized (i.e. initialized to 0)


Are s1 and s2 equivalent?
  char s1[] = { 'h', 'i' };
  char s2[] = "hi";
No, s2 has a null terminator at the end


What is the behavior of the following:
  int *arr[10];
arr is an array of int*


What is the behavior of the following:
  int &arr[10];
Error. References are not objects.


What is the behavior of the following:
  int (*arr)[10];
A pointer to an array of ten ints


What is the behavior of the following:
  int (&arr)[10] = arr2;
A reference to an array of ten ints


What is the behavior of the following:
  int *(&arr)[10] = arr2;
A reference to an array of ten int*


Which header contains types implicitly generated or used by certain language expressions?
#include <cstddef>


What type to use when indexing into an array?
size_t


Where is size_t defined?
#include <cstddef>


What is the behavior of the following:
  unsigned scores[11], grade;
  while (cin >> grade)
    if (grade <= 100) ++scores[grade/10];
scores contains uninitialized values


What is the type of x?
  int arr[] = {1, 2};
