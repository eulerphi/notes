Chapter 4


What is an lvalue?
When we use an object as an lvalue, we use its identity (its location in memory)


What is an rvalue?
When we use an object as a rvalue, we use its value (its content)


When to use an lvalue versus an rvalue?
Can use an lvalue when an rvalue is required, but cannot use an rvalue when an lvalue is required.


What is the behavior of the following:
  int i = 0;
  cout << i << ' ' << ++i << endl;
Undefined. It is an error for an expression to refer to and change the same object.


What is the value of b2?
  bool b = true;
  bool b2 = -b;
b2 == true (-b promotes b to an int value of 1, then negates it which is nonzero)


What is the value of b?
  int i = 3, j = 2, k = 1;
  bool b = i < j < k;
True. i < j => 0. 0 < 1 => true


What is the value of b?
  bool b = val == true;
True if val == 1, false otherwise
