Chapter 4


What is an lvalue?
When we use an object as an lvalue, we use its identity (its location in memory)


What is an rvalue?
When we use an object as a rvalue, we use its value (its content)


When to use an lvalue versus an rvalue?
Can use an lvalue when an rvalue is required, but cannot use an rvalue when an lvalue is required.


What is the behavior of the following:
  int i = 0;
  cout << i << ' ' << ++i << endl;
Undefined. It is an error for an expression to refer to and change the same object.


What is the value of b2?
  bool b = true;
  bool b2 = -b;
b2 == true (-b promotes b to an int value of 1, then negates it which is nonzero)


What is the value of b?
  int i = 3, j = 2, k = 1;
  bool b = i < j < k;
True. i < j => 0. 0 < 1 => true


What is the value of b?
  bool b = val == true;
True if val == 1, false otherwise


What is the behavior of the following:
  vector<int> xs; auto it = xs.begin();
  *it = toupper(*it++);
Undefined. It might evaluate to either:
*it = toupper(*it);
*(it + 1) = toupper(*it);


What is the behavior of the following:
  int x = 42;
  x = ~x;
How the sign bit is handled is machine dependent. Use unsigned types with bitwise operators.


Is the following valid:
  int *p;
  cout << sizeof *p;
Yes, sizeof does not evaluate its operand. Thus p is not deferenced.

What is the behavior of the following:
  int x = 42, *p = &x;
  cout << sizeof p << sizeof *p;
The size of the pointer (in bytes), then the size of int in bytes.


What is the behavior of the following:
  flag ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y;
VC++: error, gcc: --y is always evaluated.


What is the type of x?
  auto x = 3.14L + 'a';
Long double. 'a' is converted to int, then converted to long double.


What is the type of x?
  double d; int i;
  auto x = d + i;
Double. i is converted to double.


What is the type of x?
  double d; float f;
  auto x = d + f;
Double. f is converted to double.


What is the type of x?
  char c; float f;
  auto x = c + f;
Float. c converted to int, then to float.


What is the type of x?
  char c; short s;
  auto x = c + s;
Int. c and s are both promoted to int.


What is the type of x?
  float f; int i;
  auto x = f + i;
Float. i converted to float.
