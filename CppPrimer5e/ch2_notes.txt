6 significant digits


What is double's min precision?
10 significant digits

64 bits


Is char signed or unsigned?
It depends on the compiler


How should signed types be represented according to the standard?
The standard does not specify a representation.


What is the supported range of signed types according to the standard?
The range should be evenly divided between positive and negative values.


Should you use char to store small integers?
No, char is signed on some machines and unsigned on others.


What type should you use to store a small integer?
Either signed chat or unsigned char (not char).


What is value of a bool when assigned a non-bool arithmetic value?
False if 0, true otherwise


What is the value of a non-bool when assigned a bool value?
1 if the bool is true, 0 if the bool is false


What is the value of an unsigned type when assigned an out-of-range value?
The value modulo the number of values the type can hold (i.e. unsigned char a = -1; // a == 255)


What is the value of a signed type when assigned an out-of-range value?
This is undefined behavior


What happens when both a signed and unsigned values are used in an expression?
The signed type is converted to an unsigned type.


What is the output of the following program?
  unsigned u = 10;
  int i = -42;
  std::cout << u + i << std::endl;
(std::numeric_limits<unsigned>.max() - 42) + u // i is converted to type unsigned


What is the output of the following program?
  for (unsigned u = 10; u >= 0; --u)
      std::cout << u << std:endl;
The loop never terminates (u is always >= 0).
