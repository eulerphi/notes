What is the behavior of the following:
  if (cond1)
    if (cond2)
      cout << "x";
  else
    cout << "y";
The behavior does not match the indentation. Actually:
if (cond1)
  if (cond2)
    cout << "x";
  else
    cout << "y";


What is the behavior of the following:
  if (int i = get_value())
    cout << "i != 0";

  char ch = getVal(); int i = 42;
  switch (ch) { case i: break; }
Error. Case labels must be constant integral values.

  switch (ch) { case 3.12: break; }
Error. Case labels must be constant integral values.
